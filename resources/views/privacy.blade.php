                    <h6>Privacy Policy</h6>
                    <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Revisit Coupon Company Inc. ("AlfaSoft LLC.", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide on the yeps.io (the "Website") and Yeps (the "App" or "Service"). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
                    <h6>Automatic Collection Of Information</h6>
                    <p>
                        When you visit the Website and App our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website or App, pages of our Website or App that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website or App, access times and dates, and other statistics.
                        <br>
                        Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Collection Of Personal Information</h6>
                    <p>
                        You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual.
                        <br>
                        If, however, you wish to use some of the Website’s features and App, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online forms on the Website and App. When required, this information may include the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
                            <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
                            <li>Store name, store URL, timezone, etc.</li>
                            <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as screenshots, feedback, etc</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website’s features or use the App. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Storing Personal Information</h6>
                    <p>
                        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Information Transfer And Storage</h6>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Privacy Of Children</h6>
                    <p>
                        We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website, App or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Website, App or Service without their permission.

                        If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through our Website, App or Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                    </p>
                    <h6>Do Not Track Signals</h6>
                    <p>
                        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is partially set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.
